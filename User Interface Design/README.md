# Assignment 4 - User Interface Design

## **1. Introduction**
RedMoon Fantasy is an **online MMORPG** originally developed for **Windows NT-based systems**. Due to compatibility challenges with newer **Windows operating systems** such as **Windows 8, 10, and 11**, the project aims to enhance **cross-version compatibility across all Windows platforms**. The UI serves as an essential interface for user interaction, including **account management, ranking views, online tracking, and in-game store purchases**. Additionally, the project focuses on **refining the CSS for improved usability** and ensuring **full compliance with ADA Level 2 accessibility standards**, which have not yet been fully implemented. 

These improvements will make the interface **more accessible and user-friendly**, aligning with **modern design standards** while maintaining the gameâ€™s **legacy functionality**.
